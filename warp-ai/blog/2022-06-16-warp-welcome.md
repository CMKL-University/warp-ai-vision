Hello everyone! :-)

Welcome to AiCE Warp - **AI Applications in Computer Vision**.

In this competency, We'll explore how AI can be used to help computers **"see"** and perform various tasks on images or video streams We'll cover fundamental concepts of computer vision including basic image representations, manipulation and filtering. Through a series of hands-on exercises, you’ll learn about basic neural networks and deep learning concepts that can be used to solve computer vision tasks. You’ll also learn about the tools such as **PyTorch** that can be used to build or train your deep learning model and applications.
