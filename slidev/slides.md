# What is Computer Vision?
Computer vision is a field in computing that focuses on creating a digital system that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data.
- Given input images/videos (representation)
- Processing (math alert!)
- Output (interpretation or decision)

# Tools & Tasks

Ok, that's quite a lot. Where do I get started?

- üêç **Python** - Another programming language? [Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/python-language/)
- üíª **IDE** - Try [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) or [DataSpell](https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/)
- üßÆ **NumPy** - Get familiar with arrays & matrix manipulations; see [NumPy Tutorial](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html)

If you've already got the basics:

- üìù **Tutorial** - Head over to our [tutorial contents](https://cmkl-university.github.io/warp-ai-vision/) (we'll cover them in labs)
- üßø **Seeing AI** - Get together in groups & think about building your project over the next 5 weeks
