# Mask R-CNN

## What is Mask R-CNN

Mask R-CNN is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and state-of-the-art in terms of [image segmentation](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/image-segmentation-using-deep-learning/). This variant of a [Deep Neural Network](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/deep-neural-network-three-popular-types/) detects objects in an image and generates a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. 

Here is one example of a pair of images and segmentation masks.

## What is R-CNN

The term R-CNN or RCNN, stands for Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network, it is a type of machine learning model that is used for computer vision tasks, specifically for object detection.

## How to implement the Mask R-CNN in PyTorch

Here are some resources about training Mask R-CNN in PyTorch.
