# Bitmap, Filters and Image Kernel

## Bitmap

bitmap, method by which a display space (such as [graphics](https://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-art) image file) is defined, including the [colour](https://www.britannica.com/science/color) of each of its [pixels](https://www.britannica.com/technology/pixel) (or [bits](https://www.britannica.com/technology/bit-communications)). 

Here are additional resources for [bitmaps](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/bitmaps/).

## Filters

Filtering techniques are use to enhance and modify digital images. Also, images filters are use to blurring and noise reduction, sharpening and edge detection. Image filters are mainly use for suppress high (smoothing techniques) and low frequencies(image enhancement, edge detection). Classification of image filters is as follows.

## Image Kernel

An image kernel is a small matrix used to apply effects like the ones you might find in Photoshop or Gimp, such as blurring, sharpening, outlining or embossing. They're also used in machine learning for 'feature extraction', a technique for determining the most important portions of an image. In this context the process is referred to more generally as "convolution" (see: [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network).)
