Through a series of hands-on exercises, you\u2019ll learn about basic neural networks and deep learning concepts that can be used to solve computer vision tasks. You\u2019ll also learn about the tools such as **PyTorch** that can be used to build or train your deep learning model and applications.\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e"}]}')}}]);
